# Universe Code Playground

Universe is the easiest way to make a website. Choose a custom domain, build your site, and share it in less than a minuteâ€”all on your iPhone, for free. Get it at [onuniverse.com](onuniverse.com).

The new **Code Block** lets you run custom web code in your Universe site. This playground makes it easy to create your own blocks and see how they will respond to the Universe grid.

If you're new to programming or don't know where to start, check out the Code Block Gallery in the Universe app for ideas.

## Getting started
1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. Open `code-block.html` in your text editor. (Lost? Get [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/))

4. Write HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Save the file and refresh your browser to see changes. Stretch the block and see how it responds.

5. When you're happy, copy everything in `code-block.html`, and paste it into a Code Block in the Universe app.

## Code Block Guidelines
* The Universe grid is very flexible. Play around with how your block responds to different sizes and orientations.

* Try out your code on a few different browsers to make sure everything works.

* Scripts and stylesheets should be included inside `code-block.html` or hosted elsewhere and linked in your code.

* Images must be hosted elsewhere.

* Avoid creating Code Blocks that scroll.

* Have fun!

## Pro Tips
Permanently change the Code Block's size and position by changing these values at the bottom of `extras/script.js`:

```javascript
// Set Code Block's starting position and size in columns and rows
CodeBlock.set({
  left: 1,
  top: 1,
  width: 2,
  height: 2
})
```
