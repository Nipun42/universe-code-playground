The new Code Block lets you run custom web code in your Universe site. This starter kit makes it easy to create your own blocks and see how they react when stretched in different directions.

If you're new to programming or don't know where to start, check out the Code Block Gallery in the Universe app for ideas.

## Getting started
1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. Open `code-block.html` in your text editor. (Lost? Get [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/))

4. Write HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Save the file and refresh your browser to see changes. Stretch the block and see how it responds.

5. When you're happy, copy everything in `code-block.html`, and paste it into a Code Block in the Universe app.
